This project has been made to be a school based app. It will provide a calculator, online drawing function, 
note taking, online classroom linked to youtube and a chat function so that children can talk to friends.

My key learning goals for this project:
-learn some basics of Vue
-attempt typescript with Vue
-improve writing comments in the code with this project
-learn to use drawio or something similar
-learn websockets for chat funciton or something similar


This is my first time using Vue. It is being written as a personal challange and to explore view and acquiant myself with
its syntax. Currently I feel comfortable with vanilla javascript and react.

Currently I am between a few projects so I won't focus too heavily on this project but I wanted to prove to myself that
I can learn another framework. 

The plan is:
-first: calculator(simple, it won't be the most complex calcultor but I will instansiated one)
-navbar and landing page
-online drawing function(possibly with drawio)
-a note taking function
-an online classroom connected to youtube(just a few links to lessons so children can watch and work with them)
-a chat function so that children cna learn

I will attempt as a stretch once I understand Vue better to use typescript.

Additionally, I am going to learn to comment sections of code, cleanly to add a better understanding as an attempt
to make code more clear, especially things which I am using for the first time or I am not familiar with as a reference point for myself  and for any beginner or anyone looking at my code so it is more immediately obvious what is happening.
https://blog.submain.com/4-reasons-need-code-comments/ : I have been reading about comment writing and think it might improve code, my process and my learning in addtion to making things clearer for others so I would like to improve my comment writing

Another stretch goal depending on how my other projects go will be to make a server to save drawings, notes and chat. Again depending on other projects,as this is a side project, I might attempt a simple restful API in Java.

If all that goes well, I would like to make it responsive for phones.

A final stretch goal will be to dockerise it and deploy it on Azure.
